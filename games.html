                        <p>A simple little puzzle game, inspired in part by games like Chip's Challenge. The object of the game is to clear each of the four zones, then escape the final zone. Each zone has a different theme, and new mechanics and puzzles are introduced throughout the game. There are 35 levels in total, ranging from simple to fiendishly difficult.</p>
                        <p>The game was first publicly showcased at the Green Mountain Games Festival, where it was fairly well received. The final game had a lackluster release, however, due to naive design choices made early in development. Just for fun, here's an example: The level loader has no support for prefabs, so <b>all objects had to be fully defined from scratch every time I used them</b>. Even a simple improvement like making coins sparkle when you pick them up would've been a nightmarish task of herculean proportions, even with the excessive use of scripts and macros.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, I took those lessons to heart.</p>

                        <p>You are Space Douchebag, the greatest douchebag in the universe. When your swag is stolen by aliens, it's up to you to exact your vengeance!</p>
                        <p>This game was made for my Graphics I class during my Sophomore year of college. It started as a generic space shooter, becoming Space Douchebag when I couldn't think of a good reason to have my protagonist fly around shooting aliens. From there, I came up with the concept of making ship's hitbox a manifestation of Space Douchebag's ego, which shrinks when shot. The game was intended to be much longer, but content was cut due to time constraints. It's still fun, though, and I think it's actually one of the better entries in my collection. I plan to eventually revisit it and produce a remake.</p>
                        <p>My friend and colleague, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/peter-orzell">Peter Orzell</a>, composed a wonderful original soundtrack for the game. I recall him mentioning that another artist contributed to the first boss theme, Earth Mover, but I don't know who it is so I am unable to properly credit them. It's also possible that I'm misremembering things and they never existed.</p>

                        <p>Growgue is a roguelike with a unique farming mechanic. Patches of fertile soil can be found throughout the game, and once tilled they can have seeds planted in them. This was intended to be the player's main source of food, items, and utility abilities (such as planting traps and vines that could take you to other levels). However, a deadly combination of Business, Laziness, and Bugginess kept this game from ever reaching its full potential. It's technically complete, but pretty confusing and half-baked.</p>

                        <p>For this game, I decided to try something a bit different: The map is a giant line, going from the point where you start in the east to the final boss far to the west. The map will not scroll up or down, and you have little reason to travel to the right. Instead, you spend most of the game going to the left and dealing with whatever you find.</p>
                        <p>The game featured a number of really cool features during development, such as a faction system that caused NPC infighting and allied NPCs. However, many features had to be scrapped due to a number of memory-related errors. I would've tried to fix them, but since this was a game jam entry I didn't have enough time. The game itself still works, however</p>

                        <p>One of the few games ever made using DFEngine, Day of the Hotdog was, in fact, built entirely off of a bad pun. DFEngine was quite limited at the time that I made it, so I took extra care when coming up with game ideas. It had to be a game without actual levels, in 2D, with few features besides a physics engine. As a result, bouncing hotdogs on a barbeque seemed like a pretty obvious summer mechanic. And really, once you're there how could you <b>not</b> add a mechanic centered around knocking bald eagles out of the sky, then catching and grilling them on your barbeque? It's the American way!</p>

                        <h1>Something Something Office Rampage</h1>
                        <p>You've just been downsized by Ivil Incorporated, <b>a completely legitimate and not secretly performing dark and twisted scientific experiments in hidden laboratories deep below the earth business</b>, and you must go on a murderous rampage that involves painting the walls with blood (a feature missing from far too many roguelikes) and stealing office supplies.<br/>Made for 7DRL 2014.</p>
                        <p>Something Something Office Rampage was my first 7DRL entry, and also my first Roguelike. As a result, I didn't really take a lot of risks, unlike every other roguelike that I've made since then. When thinking up of a setting, my thought process was something along the lines of: What if Dilbert lost his mind one day and went on a rampage? Wait, office workers are still too boring of an enemy. &#8230;But what if Dilbert was working for the Umbrella Corporation and had no idea?</p>
                        <p>From that jumbled mess arose a decent little hack'n'slash roguelike. If I had to charge SSOR with a crime, it would be being too long and repetitive. It as good ideas, and it's entertaining, but it wears out its welcome by stretching the content out too much. I think at the time I expected most 7DRL entries to be quite long, so I tried to pad the game out by making the player traverse around 45 floors when 10-20 would've been enough.</p>

                        <p>This project was never ported to Windows, even though I had every intention of doing so. It was my first time using CMake as my build system, and due to issues getting it to compile my work on Windows I quit in disgust. Despite the fact that the CMake issues were caused by my inexperience, it still turned out to be a great decision. Not only did I become really good at writing makefiles by hand (and by extension, deciphering giant arcane blocks of code), this also eventually led to my adoption of the <a href="http://mesonbuild.com/">Meson build system</a>, which is, in my humble opinion, far better than CMake in every respect. All's well that ends well, right?</p>
                        <p>Another interesting thing about this game is the recurrence of the "protagonist" of A Wheelie Good Time, Doomsday Darren. I was going to try and fit this character into my games periodically, but as of now (September 2016) he's yet to make a return. Like many of my games, this game suffers from being too long for its own good. Because the content of the game is spread too thinly, it loses its appeal long before you actually complete it.</p>
                        <p>The game's soundtrack was composed by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/peter-orzell">Peter Orzell</a>, a good friend and colleague of mine.</p>

                        <h1>Diamond Rush</h1>
                        <p>You are the mighty Diamond Titan, placed deep within a cave to ward off would-be heroes who might seek the Macguffin that you guard. However, you forgot one thing: The only thing heroes love more than plot points is loot! Hop for your life, Diamond Titan!<br/>Created for Global Game Jam 2013.</p>
                        <p>I think this is one of my better game jam entries. I recall that part of the jam's theme was a heartbeat sound, and I didn't want to make a game with a heart. I figured most people would just put hearts in their games, and that I needed to find a different interpretation of the sound. So, I decided that the sound was the footsteps of something huge hopping and skipping around. Then, I needed a reason to make it hop in the first place, and the story of the Diamond Titan was born.</p>
                        <p>The game's soundtrack was composed by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/peter-orzell">Peter Orzell</a>, a good friend and colleague of mine.</p>
                        <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
                        <p>You direct movement via the orange cursor, which is controlled with the mouse. The Titan will automatically try to jump to it. Be warned, though: You cannot control it while it's in the air. The heroes will damage you if you land on/near them. If you run out of health, it's Game Over.</p>
                        <h3>Score Values</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collect purple crystals for 50 points each.</li>
                            <li>Completing a level will give you 100 points times the level number.</li>
                            <li>Every point of health remaining when you win give you a 25 point bonus.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You are a wheelie bad dude. You'd like to go destroy the city, but your doctor told you that you need exercise. That's when you get a cunning plan (because that's how you roll, of course) to destroy and exercise at the same time! What could go wrong?</p>
                        <p>I swear these puns get more stale every year.<br/>The game was originally called Ultramarathon of Doom, which was decent but slightly misleading, so I ended up changing it. After all these years, I honestly don't know how or why I came up with this concept. The jam's theme was "You are the villain", but where did the giant city-crushing wheel come from? It's a mystery.</p>

                        <h1>Chainsaw Deathrace</h1>
                        <p>Control 3 plucky teenagers as they escape a crazed chainsaw-wielding maniac! There's a catch, though: they've already lost a few limbs.<br/>Created for a game jam at Champlain College.</p>
                        <p>Technically, this is my second game jam entry. Unfortunately, the first game was lost to the sands of time so it's missing from the list. Chainsaw Deathrace came from my desire to make a Halloween-themed game. I wanted to make a game about a generic masked horror movie killer, but the jam's theme was "disability". Naturally, playing as a terrifying masked killer isn't a huge disability on its own, so I turned my attention to the victims: Billy, Sammy, and Fred. I decided to make a horror-movie roguelike about a bunch of already-attacked teenagers, but I was a terrible programmer at the time so I just made a single level by hand. I was working on an actual-roguelike remake of the game, but never finished. I still want to make the game eventually, but it likely won't happen for a very long time.</p>
                        <p>Fun Fact: If you play the game perfectly, by taking the right doors, you will never encounter the Chainsaw Killer.</p>
